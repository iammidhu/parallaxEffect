  <h1 class="main-heading">Roger Federer</h1>
  <div class="content right illustration_01">


    <h2>This is not the end</h2>
    <p> You could say that. Federer is only missing one event, after all. </p>
    <p> His career—not to mention his life—will go on, and his fans will indeed be able to look into his eyes again.</p>
    <p>In his announcement, Federer said he plans to be at Roland Garros in 2017, and even as he nears his 35th birthday this summer, he “remains as motivated and excited as ever.”</p>
    <p>From the start of this season, he has made it clear that Wimbledon, the Olympics and the U.S. Open are the big fish he wants to fry. Skipping Paris gives him a better chance of doing that.</p>
    <p> Still, the above tweet wasn’t the only one that detected something ominous in Federer’s withdrawal.</p>
    <p>For a few hours, Twitter turned into one big, frowny-face emoticon. But if the reaction was overwrought, it was also understandable.</p>
    <p>While Federer is no longer dominant, he has always been present. This will be the first Grand Slam he’ll miss since 1999; his 65 consecutive appearances is a record for both tours. For years, the sport’s fans have asked, or studiously avoided asking,
      “What will tennis do when Roger is gone?” It’s a question that’s especially relevant at Roland Garros.</p>
    <p>
      In the nearly two decades that I’ve been writing about tennis, no player, even in his or her home country, has been as intensely adored as Federer is by the French.
    </p>
    <p>
      Devotees of artistic play, he’s their sporting ideal, their tennis truth. Parisians aren’t the only ones who feel that way about him. Federer’s appeal is elastic enough that he has come to embody what each Slam loves about the game most.

    <h2>What a Grand Slam without Roger means</h2>
    <p>It’s been 17 years since his streak began, and his absence will make many of us inexplicably sad. Not because he could have won the French Open this year; he almost certainly could not have. The sadness stems from the jarring reality that the Roger era is fast coming to a close. </p>
    s<p>His fitness has been an issue all year, and his first ever injury-related surgery was this February. </p>
    <p>Federer is playing on borrowed time. Honestly, he has tricked history, precedent, and the odds by maintaining a level of excellence that only extends his place as the presumptive tennis’s greatest of all time (‘GOAT’)</p>
    <p>In the middle of a radically dominant run by Novak Djokovic, and the once unlikely resurgence of Rafael Nadal on clay, proclaiming Federer as the greatest ever is more than likely to be contested. But Federer’s greatness goes beyond his record 17 majors, a Davis Cup title, and Olympic medals — silver in singles and gold in doubles.</p>
